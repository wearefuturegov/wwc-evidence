        Mellow Parenting
      %h4
        Mellow Parenting (MP) is a programme designed to promote sensitive parenting. It aims to improve attachment through addressing parental mental health as well as developing better parent-child relationships.

          How is it meant to work?
        %p
          Mellow Parenting is a group-based approach designed to support families who are experiencing relationship challenges with their young children and who have additional health and social care needs. 
        %p
          It is a flexible programme based on principles from attachment theory, adult education and behavioural psychology that also offers practical help (for instance help with transport and childcare). MP has also been modified for different groups (such as Mellow Fathers, Mellow Babies etc).
        %p
          Most studies included focused on the main Mellow Parenting intervention (aimed at children aged 1-4), but two focused on Mellow Babies (for children under one year old).

          How effective is it?
        %p
          MP was shown to have a 
          %strong
            medium positive effect 
          for families at high risk of adverse outcomes. Improvements were seen in both parental mental health and child behavioural problems.
        %p
          However, data types were diverse and results showed some signs of methodological bias. It becomes more difficult to draw firm conclusions based on 
          %strong
            xxxx-xxx quality of evidence.
        %p
          The effect should be interpreted as a 
          %strong
            positive indication 
          that the intervention may be effective for children and families.

          Where has it been studied?
        %p
          The studies were carried out in Russia, Scotland, New Zealand and Northern Ireland. More evidence from the UK would help us understand how MP works in a local context.

          Who does this work for?
        %p
          Specific subgroups have not been identified in the studies so far. One study, however, found that MP was not likely to benefit children with reactive attachment disorders.

          When does it work best?
        %p
          The assumption is that programmes like Mellow Parenting, that have a focus on parental mental health and parental sensitivity, lead to improved outcomes for childhood psychological development.
        %p
          But at the moment there is little explanation to support findings or details of the specific routes to outcomes. Future evaluations of MP should develop more detail on the nature of expected outcomes. For example, considering the types of childhood outcomes that should be tested.

          How does it work in practice?
        %p
          There are few details of specific successes or challenges of implementing MP across different cases. However, use of video feedback and interactive tasks were identified as key enablers to programme delivery.  
        %p
          Also, the fact that MP can be delivered by non-specialists who can then work to accreditation as a practitioner gives the programme greater reach.

            This effect applies to both outcomes studied: improved parental mental health and child problem behaviour

            However, most studies have been small and methodologically limited
          %li
            More research in needed on how MP might be implemented, and the causal pathways linking the intervention and its effects
          %li
            We donâ€™t know about the costs and benefits of MP programmes so future studies should examine these
