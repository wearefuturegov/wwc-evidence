  title: Intensive Family Preservation Programmes
  intro: Intensive Family Preservation Programmes (IFPPs) are interventions aimed at families in crisis, where there is an imminent risk of children entering care. They are programmes that work intensively with families to try to avoid out-of-home placement.
  how: |
    These programmes provide a rapid response (within 24 hours of referral) and intensive (4-6 week) support including a range of services to families in crisis, tailored to the family’s needs. Typically, the programmes includes parenting training, therapeutic input for adults and/or children and practical or financial support. By intervening at times of crisis, IFPPs seek to stabilise families and help them to provide “good-enough” parenting, as well as helping to build resilience in case of future crises.
    In the US, this is referred to as the ‘Homebuilders’ model. In the UK, an IFPP model called ‘Option 2’ has been developed specifically for families where there are serious child protection concerns related to drug or alcohol misuse.

      title: Families not initially judged at risk of children entering care
  more_effective:
    - Boys compared to girls
    - Younger compared to older children
  works_best:
    - If people delivering intervention have small caseloads
    - Intensity is more important than duration of the intervention
  in_practice: The evidence suggests that IFPPs can help families with multiple problems whose issues are not linked to abuse and neglect. They can help to avoid risk escalating and leading to removal of children. There was little evidence about the mechanisms for this.
  costs_benefits: There is no evidence on the cost-benefit of this intervention.
  implementation_attributes:
    intro: There is little information in this study on implementation. The information below comes from original reports.
    deliverer: Social workers
    support: Limited caseloads for those delivering the intervention
  key_points:
    -  IFPPs appear to have a positive effect on family functioning, but overall, there was no evidence of a statistically significant effect on reducing numbers of children entering care. Desired outcomes need to be clear
    -  IFPPs have been used across a wider range of family types than originally intended, and they seem to work better for some groups than for others
    -  IFPSs seem to have a negative effect when used with low-risk families, so agencies should be cautious about which families this is right for
    -  Most of the studies included are from the USA and we do not know how the findings relate to the UK context
    -  We do not know about the costs and benefits of IFPPs
    -  This is a high-intensity programme – those delivering should have relatively small caseloads

  title: Interventions to improve maternal-child attachment
  intro:  This is a range of interventions developed to improve attachment between mothers and their babies in the early stages of the children’s lives.
  how: |
     Because there are many different interventions, the focus of this review is on the impact of intervening rather than the impact of any specific intervention, and looks at two outcomes related to attachment.

     Interventions include (but are not limited to): home visiting services, group workshops with video-based feedback, infant massage, cognitive restructuring and mother and baby psychotherapy.

      title: Reflective functioning
      effect: moderate_effect
      evidence: moderate_quality
  studies:  The majority of the studies have been carried out in the US. There has been one study in the UK. However, location might be less important for interventions of this kind than for other programmes (such as those that involve wider services and community support).

      title: Low-risk families
  works_best: Because this isn’t a detailed examination of each intervention, it doesn’t contain an in-depth review of the individual mechanisms. But it does point to some aspects that might be particularly important
  in_practice: |
     The theory is that these interventions improve maternal sensitivity and reflective function, which then promotes secure maternal-child attachment.

     It’s argued that a more secure maternal-child attachment lays the foundations for children’s healthy social and mental development.

     But it is also worth noting that there are ongoing debates about the role of attachment in a range of outcomes when interpreting the impact of attachment on the long-term wellbeing of children.
  in_practice: There is no evidence on the cost-benefit of this intervention.
  implementation_attributes:
    intro: |
      While it’s difficult to compare a range of various interventions, there are some consistent key features:

      ## Most interventions involved few sessions

      Although the most effective intervention involved intensive psychotherapy, the other effective interventions were far less intensive. Three studies showed benefits after only 2-4 home visits, and two others had 8-16 sessions.
      
      ## Most interventions started when children were 3-9 months

      This challenges the notion that effective interventions must begin at birth and gives more scope to implement interventions later.
      
      ## Video feedback was a consistent tool

      Video feedback featured in all but one of the successful interventions. This may be one of the “active ingredients” that help deliver the reported benefits.
    support: Limited caseloads for those delivering the intervention
  key_points:
    - There is strong evidence for the benefits of a range of interventions to improve maternal-child attachment security
    - Varied interventions means that there is less known on individual aspects that create the reported benefits
    - Key features of effective interventions need further exploration, to better understand which aspects create the benefits
    - Interventions seem to have the greatest benefit for high-risk families
    - The use of video feedback appears to be a key feature
    - Ongoing debates mean that there should be caution when interpreting the impact of attachment on the long-term wellbeing of children
    - An important question that is not addressed is how long the observed changes
