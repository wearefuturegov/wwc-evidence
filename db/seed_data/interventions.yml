  title: Intensive Family Preservation Programmes
  intro: Intensive Family Preservation Programmes (IFPPs) are interventions aimed at families in crisis, where there is an imminent risk of children entering care. They are programmes that work intensively with families to try to avoid out-of-home placement.
  how: |
    These programmes provide a rapid response (within 24 hours of referral) and intensive (4-6 week) support including a range of services to families in crisis, tailored to the family’s needs. Typically, the programmes includes parenting training, therapeutic input for adults and/or children and practical or financial support. By intervening at times of crisis, IFPPs seek to stabilise families and help them to provide “good-enough” parenting, as well as helping to build resilience in case of future crises.
    In the US, this is referred to as the ‘Homebuilders’ model. In the UK, an IFPP model called ‘Option 2’ has been developed specifically for families where there are serious child protection concerns related to drug or alcohol misuse.

  title: Interventions to improve maternal-child attachment
  intro:  This is a range of interventions developed to improve attachment between mothers and their babies in the early stages of the children’s lives.
  how: |
     Because there are many different interventions, the focus of this review is on the impact of intervening rather than the impact of any specific intervention, and looks at two outcomes related to attachment.

     Interventions include (but are not limited to): home visiting services, group workshops with video-based feedback, infant massage, cognitive restructuring and mother and baby psychotherapy.

  studies:  The majority of the studies have been carried out in the US. There has been one study in the UK. However, location might be less important for interventions of this kind than for other programmes (such as those that involve wider services and community support).
  works_best: Because this isn’t a detailed examination of each intervention, it doesn’t contain an in-depth review of the individual mechanisms. But it does point to some aspects that might be particularly important
  implementation_attributes:
    intro: |
      While it’s difficult to compare a range of various interventions, there are some consistent key features:

      ## Most interventions involved few sessions

      Although the most effective intervention involved intensive psychotherapy, the other effective interventions were far less intensive. Three studies showed benefits after only 2-4 home visits, and two others had 8-16 sessions.
      
      ## Most interventions started when children were 3-9 months

      This challenges the notion that effective interventions must begin at birth and gives more scope to implement interventions later.
      
      ## Video feedback was a consistent tool

      Video feedback featured in all but one of the successful interventions. This may be one of the “active ingredients” that help deliver the reported benefits.
    support: Limited caseloads for those delivering the intervention
  key_points:
    - There is strong evidence for the benefits of a range of interventions to improve maternal-child attachment security
    - Varied interventions means that there is less known on individual aspects that create the reported benefits
    - Key features of effective interventions need further exploration, to better understand which aspects create the benefits
    - Interventions seem to have the greatest benefit for high-risk families
    - The use of video feedback appears to be a key feature
    - Ongoing debates mean that there should be caution when interpreting the impact of attachment on the long-term wellbeing of children
    - An important question that is not addressed is how long the observed changes
